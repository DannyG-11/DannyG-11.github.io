                    <h3>Fish Collection Method</h3>
                    <p>To collect the fish, the method of electrofishing was implemented. Electrofishing is a method
                        that sends an electric current into the water which stuns the fish periodically, so they are able to be
                        scooped up in a net (Cooke, 2018). It can either be done through a boat or a backpack and in this case, a
                        backpack was used. The fish were collected into buckets and then transferred into a larger holding tank.
                        Once the fish we collected from each site, they were identified, measured for their total length
                        in mm and weighed in lbs. A photo of each species of fish identified was taken. The fish were then
                        released back into their respective environments.</p>

                    <h3>Observations and Discussion</h3>
                    <p>
                        The pumpkin seed is most commonly found in each habitat type with three being found in the pond environment and 12 being found in the river environment. Pumpkin seeds like calm or slow-moving waters so both these environments are suitable for it to inhabit (Government of Canada, 2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For all the pumpkin seed was found most commonly overall add a total of 15 individuals collected. However, the blue girl was a close second at 14 individuals collected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The brown bullhead catfish appears to be the most highly specialized because it was only found in the pond environment which is its most suitable habitat. The brown bullhead catfish has also adapted to live in lower quality water that doesn’t have as much oxygen and reaches higher temperatures (Brown bullhead). These conditions are common in pond environments because the water doesn't get much circulation which can cause the water to heat up and have low oxygen. They also have a heightened sense of smell and are good at feeling around which helps them find their food in cloudy water which is commonly present in ponds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The species that appears to be the least specialized is the pumpkin seed because it was found in both environments, so it hasn’t adapted to specifically thrive under certain conditions. It also has quite bold colouring which is abnormal due to the dull colours of its environment. It would be predicted that through adaptation it would have morphed its colours to blend into its environment as to not attract predators however that is not the case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I were to design a study that would generate the best estimate of overall fish abundant and overall fish diversity, I would ensure that each area that is being tested is tested multiple times and in multiple locations. For the study rec-conducted upper pond, we only did one purse through the pond on one side. There could’ve been many fish that were missed in this process so testing multiple times in that location along with other places around the pond would ensure a wide variety of the fish are captured. Also, we were only able to catch fish near the shore because we were using a backpack operated electro fishing technique so implementing methods that would allow us to catch fish deeper into the pond when sure that we catch a wider variety of species and fish sizes. The same concepts would also be applied to the fish collection in the river. We only tested one riverbank and passed through it once so testing it multiple times and in different areas around the river would be optimal for capturing a wider variety fish and getting a more accurate representation of the fish population in these environments. Also, testing a different seasons and times of the year would help to get an idea of how the population evolve throughout time so we can better predict the growth of these populations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Changes to the riverine habitat would influence the composition of the fish community because the fish that are currently living there are able to do to specific conditions that fit their needs. Human activities such as building a dam or increased tourism could affect these populations. If a dam is built it could change the flow of the water to be faster pace which may drive out some species such as the pumpkin seed because they are drawn to calmer waters (Government of Canada, 2018). Also, if there are more people using the river the noise from the boats could disrupt the fish residing there which would drive them away. Also, certain nesting sites could be destroyed due to humans wanting a more desirable shoreline such a sand. Humans destroying these nesting sites would prohibit fish from reproducing and would limit the population size. A non-human impact that could influence the fish community would be the natural curving of river systems. Overtime riverbanks erode and deposit new material. At some point the pond environment and the river environment could become one if the riverbank erodes into it or flooding occurs that merge the two together. This would eliminate the individual ecosystems and harm the fish that have specialized towards to the pond environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, different aquatic ecosystems are very important to the biodiversity of our planet because they provide different resources for different fish to adapt to. Observing the different species captured in each of the unique environments prove that some species are able to specialize and live more efficiently in their preferred habitat.
